      <p>Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about 
        anything...or anyone. I care! So...what do you think of her, Han? I'm 
        trying not to, kid! Good... Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't 
        know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me... No!

        Yes. Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the remains of a 
        Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted for some time. 
        They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems.
